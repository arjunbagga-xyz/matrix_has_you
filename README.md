# DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE SIMULATION

## üîç Overview
A browser-based simulation demonstrating how seemingly innocent user interactions can be analyzed to build detailed behavioral profiles. This is a **client-side only** educational tool - no data leaves your machine.

**Warning:** While this is just a simulation, real versions of this technology exist in the wild. This demo shows how little interaction is needed to infer sensitive information.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time behavioral tracking:**
  - Keystroke timing analysis
  - Mouse/touch movement profiling
  - Scroll depth monitoring
  - Input pattern recognition

- **Device fingerprinting:**
  - Hardware capabilities
  - Network characteristics
  - Software environment

- **Psychological profiling:**
  - Stress level estimation
  - Age range prediction
  - Engagement analysis

- **Threat modeling:**
  - Shows potential exploitation use cases
  - Demonstrates attack vectors

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The simulation analyzes:
- Keyboard inputs (speed, patterns)
- Pointer movements (velocity, precision)
- Scroll behavior
- Device characteristics
- Network information

All processing happens locally in your browser - check Developer Tools (F12) to verify no network calls are made.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

No data is collected, stored, or transmitted. This exists purely to demonstrate:

1. How little interaction is needed to profile users
2. What kinds of inferences can be made from basic data
3. Why digital privacy matters
